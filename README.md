# URL Shortening UI

Code Challenge by Fiachna Carter for Terem

## Approach

 1. Used Vite to create project
 1. Built static mocked version of site for styles so I could focus on functionality afterwards
 1. Wrote tests for expected behaviour
 1. Implemented Logic

## Decisions

 - Used tailwind as the design images show components which resemble tailwind styles extremely closely
 - Built mobile view first then added desktop modifications
